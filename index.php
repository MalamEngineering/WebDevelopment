	<h2>Chapter 1: The Other Minister </h2>
	<article>

	It was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting alone 
	in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping through his brain without 
	leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind. He was waiting for a call from the President 
	of a far distant country, and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone, 
	and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had been a very long, tiring, and difficult week,
	 there was not much space in his head for anything else.</article> 
	<h2>Articles . . . . </h2><article>The more he attempted to focus on the print on the page
	 before him, the more clearly the Prime Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponents. 
	 This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that 
	 had happened in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to explain why each and every 
	 one of them was the government's fault. <br/>
